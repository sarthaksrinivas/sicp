# Chapter 1
## Building Abstractions with Procedures
* computational process: abstract "essence" of computation. imperative knowledge.
* data: declarative knowledge.
* processes manipulate data.
* programs:
    * subsets of processes (imperative knowledge). 
    * patterns/sequences of rules
    * help proesses grow longer/more complex
    * goal is to help processes manipulate data.
* people use programs to manipulate processes.
* programming language:
    * composed of precise, unambiguous symbolic expressions
    * used to describe programs
* programming:
    * act of writing programs
    * is important, with real consequences
    * creates need to understand programs and anticipate results and consequences.
        * small errors (bugs or glitches)
        * large errors (semantic errors)
* software engineers:
    * understand need/task
    * can visualize solution
    * can anticipate result of solution
    * can program solution
    * can "debug" solution if needed.
* wellâ€“designed computational systems:
    * modular
    * allow parts to be constructed, replaced, debugged separately

## Programming in Lisp
* lisp:
    * language for describing procedural thoughts
    * shortening of list processing
    * provides symbol manipulation capabilites 
* recursion equations: logical expressions that are a model for computation
* lisp interpreter: machine that executes processes in lisp language
* procedures:
    * lisp's representation of procedures.
    * blur passive data and abstract processes.
